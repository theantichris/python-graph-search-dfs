# python-graph-search-dfs

A recursive implementation of a depth-first graph search in Python.

This function will return the path to the searched for value.

It accepts 4 parameters:

1. graph: the graph that will be searched
1. current_vertex: the vertex to start the search at
1. target_value: the value to search for
1. visited: a list to collect the path in

The graph is a map. Each vertex is a key. The key's value is the neighboring vertices.
